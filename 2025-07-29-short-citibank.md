# Short Citi stock!  They are incompetent and evil

I've had a Citi credit card (CC) for more than 22 years.  I've
paid my bill every single month.  They are constantly asking me if I
want to raise my credit limit (I always decline, it's high enough,
thank you).

On 7/29 they closed my account.  I spent more than 2 hours that day
and more then next on the phone trying to resolve this and get an
explanation.

In all the calls (I probably talked with 10 or more people in 2 days),
I talked to the fraud department 3 times.  The first two times, they
told me they didn't close the account and there was absolutely no
problem with my account.  The other calls to other departments always
said it was the fraud department that had put a hold on my account and
that's why it was closed.  The third time talking with the fraud
department they "unlocked" the account after asking me about a recent,
valid purchase.  I got no text messages about this purchase.  I got no
phone calls or emails.  Result: close the account!

Well, it turns out, all the information about the fraud department
being responsible was incorrect.  A lie or just misinformed?  I don't
know.  I didn't find out the real reason until 7/30.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's put all that aside and talk about billing.

When you use billpay at your bank, there is a secret threshold where
if the amount you are paying is more than that threshold, a paper
check is sent rather than sending the funds electronically.  This is
normal, but mostly it comes into play with CC payments.  Large
payments, for whatever reason, are shunted to paper instead of paying
them via electronic means.  This threshold is secret and never
disclosed.  More on that later.

In May 2025, I had a rather large CC bill.  I pay my insurance and
other bills through the card, so I can get cash back.  The bill was
paid via check.  It was sent 2 weeks before the bill was due, but by
the due date it had not been posted to the account.  So, I made a
manual payment of the same amount as the check, the day before the
bill was due.  I also stopped payment on the paper check mailed by my
bank, so I wouldn't double pay.

As soon as I made the payment, Citi posted the original payment
that my bank sent.  They dated it from the day before my manual
payment.  So, while I was talking to a customer service rep, they had
the check.

My July 2025 bill was also large, and also paid via a paper check.  It
was mailed on 6/30, and by the due date (7/10) still had not been
posted. On July 15, I made a manual payment and stopped payment of the
paper check.  I also got a refund of the interest charges.  The
customer service rep was nice enough to do that, since it was clear
they had a problem with my payment, **for a second time**.

On July 19 the check mailed in June was finally posted, but then
reversed when they realized there was a stop payment on it.

Two payments that took too long to process resulted in me making
manual payments, and two stop payments since I didn't want to pay my
bill twice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put that all aside and let's talk about statement balances.

My statement balance for July (the amount that I needed to pay to
prevent any interest charges) was inflated because of the problem with
the May payments.  The July bill was generated on June 15, and on June
15 they thought I hadn't paid my bill yet, so the payment amount for
July was inflated by amount of the May bill.  The May bill which was
paid twice.

This all cascaded into the statement generated on July 15 (due
August 10).  That payment was highly inflated.

**Here's my grave error**:

What I should have done was disable billpay for Citi until all of this
settled down, **THEN** turned it back on to be paid immediately.

Why was this a grave error?  Because the crazy statement balance on
7/15 was automatically scheduled to be paid right after I made that
bill pay change.  So, a large check was scheduled to be sent to Citi.
I called my bank and tried to stop it, but failed.  So, I put a stop
payment on that check.  That's right, this is the 3rd stop payment.
The 3rd one is one me, though, I should never have enabled bill pay
until all this blew over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, the end of this tale is that my account was closed due to exessive
stop payments.  The final phone call I had, I was told the closure was
permanent and I could only appeal to the "Office of the President"
sent via US mail.

Back to that threshold... when I was talking with a manager at
Citi, she said something she probably shouldn't have:

> Citi has a known issue, which they are trying to solve, which
> lowered the electronic payment limit.  It will take a few months to
> solve.

What I think Citi did was to lower the electronic payment limit **to
force more paper checks so people like me would now be paying their
bill late**.  I obviously don't have proof of this, but I highly doubt
it would take months to restore the limit they previously had.  It's
beyond belief.  They also could have slowed down the processing of
checks.  **My July payment took almost 3 weeks to process!!**  I think
all this was done intentionally to make money on late fees.  Multiple
people at Citi confirmed to me that **many people** were having issues
with this.  I wasn't the only one complaining of this.

At this point, I can't tell if it's massive incompetence or just plain
evil.  It's likely some of both.  The army of support reps have zero
power to resolve issues decided by software.  Was it an accident the
electronic threshold was lowered at the same time paper check
processing was slowed?  It's hard to say.

It's hard to describe the helpless feeling when being faced with
problems of this sort.  I am reminded of the
Franz Kafka novel [The Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial)
(aka _Der Process_ in German), where Josef K was "arrested and
prosecuted by a remote, inaccessiable authority, with the nature of
his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader."
