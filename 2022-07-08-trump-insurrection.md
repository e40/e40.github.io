Recap of what we know so far regarding Trump's efforts to overturn the election:

* Trump tried to [extort the country of Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49800181) for political dirt on Biden. He was impeached over it.  
* He tried to [weaponize COVID-19 politically by waging a war on mail-in ballots](https://time.com/5887438/trump-mail-in-voting/), which he knew would [favor Democrats](https://twitter.com/votesaveamerica/status/1244668694887686145).  
* Him and DeJoy tried to [manipulate the USPS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-post-office/judge-blocks-politically-motivated-changes-to-u-s-postal-service-ahead-of-election-idUSKBN26836Y).   
* Systematically and intentionally promoted [The Big Lie](https://www.axios.com/trump-2020-election-fraud-misinformation-2b4e5b92-0f9e-4fb6-8733-c2f0ceefd626.html) that the election was stolen, which tens of millions of people have come to believe.  
* Tried to [get electors](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-campaign-wants-states-to-override-electoral-votes-for-biden-is-that-possible-11605973695) to illegally cast their votes.  
* Him, his lawyers, and allies filed [60+ ridiculous lawsuits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/us/politics/republicans-voter-fraud.html) for lower courts to overturn the election (with zero evidence), oftentimes *not even arguing there was fraud* in court, yet claiming it in public.  
* Supported [an absolutely absurd case](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163492/20201211095715842_TX-v-State-MPI-Reply-2020-12-11.pdf) for SCOTUS to overturn the election (with zero evidence).    
* Summoned [Michigan GOP members](https://apnews.com/article/trump-invites-michigan-gop-white-house-6ab95edd3373ecc9607381175d6f3328) to attempt to subvert election results.  
* He undoubtedly provoked his [AG's resignation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorney-general-william-barr-resigns-effective-dec-23-11607986828) a few weeks after the election, who soon-before felt compelled to announce there was ["No widespread fraud."](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d)    
* Attended a meeting which [floated martial law](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-conspiracy-theories-elections-william-barr-6ff3dbff74aa79ee4d81f9d87b6dce9c).  
* Told election officials to ["stop counting"](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-ally-allegedly-told-arizona-official-we-need-you-stop-counting-report-1606611)  
* Suggested the [military should force states](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2020/12/19/trump-reportedly-asked-advisors-about-deploying-military-to-overturn-election/) to rehold elections.   
* Tried to get the [VP to illegally name him President](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/gop-senators-josh-hawley-election.html).  
* Called the [PA Speaker of the House](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-trump-pennsylvania-election-results/2020/12/08/4d39e16c-397d-11eb-98c4-25dc9f4987e8_story.html) in an attempt to overturn the results.  
* Pressured [Governor Brian Kemp](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-kemp-call-georgia/2020/12/05/fd8d677c-3721-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html) to push the state legislature to overturn the election.  
* Threatened [the GA Secretary of State](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html) with legal consequences if he did not find enough votes to overturn the election.  
* Tried to get an [insane conspiracy theorist](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/12/19/trump-sydney-powell-special-counsel-michael-flynn-matial-law/3978054001/) to lead a special counsel.    
* Defied and fired his own [election security officials](https://apnews.com/article/top-officials-elections-most-secure-66f9361084ccbc461e3bbf42861057a5).

* Had a draft declaration which [instructed the military to seize ballots.](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/21/read-the-never-issued-trump-order-that-would-have-seized-voting-machines-527572)  
* Directly told the DOJ to [lie about the election](https://apnews.com/article/trump-urged-justice-department-to-declare-election-corrupt-0edf178869f33ddcf72d4c739bd18a5d). "Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen"  
* [Pressured the DOJ](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/trump-pressured-doj-to-challenge-election-results-emails-show-house-panel-says.html) to file a lawsuit to SCOTUS to nullify the election.  
* Plotted the logistics of [overturning the election](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/us/politics/capitol-attack-meadows-powerpoint.html) via powerpoint with WH staff.  
* Plotted the logistics of overturning the election [with his lawyer, John Eastman](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/07/judge-eastman-emails-jan-6-committee-00037999). A federal judge, after seeing the evidence, has now suggested [multiple times](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840.260.0.pdf) both Trump and Eastman's efforts "more likely than not" constitute felonies.  
* [Incited a violent insurrection](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote) on U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Joe Biden.
