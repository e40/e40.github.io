# Morton's neuroma and MBT shoes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morton's neuroma is a painful condition that affects the ball of your
foot, most commonly the area between your third and fourth
toes. Morton's neuroma may feel as if you are standing on a pebble in
your shoe or on a fold in your sock.  For me, it manifests as a
shooting pain when I walk.

Around 2007, I found Sketchers Shape Ups.  They were marketed badly
and were sued because of false claims, but wearing those shoes led me
to a company called MBT, which made similar style of _rocker_ shoes.

In 2007 I had been walking to and from work for 12 years and I guess
that combined with my relatively flat feet caused the condition I
still live with today.

The Sketches and MBTs literally allowed me to continue walking.  They
were a life saver.

Today, Sketchers no longer sells a rocker shoe and MBT is in a death
spiral.  My only proof of MBT's death spiral is circumstantial, but
numerous:

* I've been trying to purchase EE width shoes from their
  [website](https://us.mbt.com/) for more than a year. I've called
  their sales team numerous times.  I've emailed them.  They keep
  telling me "they are coming" yet they are never in stock.

* Footwear Etc, a long-time distributor of MBT shoes stopped carrying
  them more than a year ago because they could not get inventory.

* MBT's own website lists places where you can get their shoes, but
  those businesses do not stock them (e.g. Footprint in SF).

* MBT's website is falling apart.  The "FIND A STORE" page no longer
  works.  I could not even input an address or zip code without a
  popup "This page can't load Google Maps correctly.  Do you own this
  website?"

When I saw a podiatrist at my health care provider, I was fitted with
a metatarsal pad, which only caused pain and I had to remove once I
left the doctor's office.  The
[]American Podiatric Medical Association](https://www.apma.org/Patients/Company.cfm?ItemNumber=22691)
lists MBT as a solution, in a very large list of companies.

I've tried Hoka and Brooks shoes, as suggested by my physical
therapist and neither shoe provided any relief.

MBT shoes appear to be the last remaining solution to a common foot
problem, yet no one seems to care they are slipping into oblivion.
