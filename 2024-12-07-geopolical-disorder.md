I thought the Trump people were fucking nuts and couldn't believe how
much shit they were willing to eat every single day and how loud they
were about the dumbest bullshit but now I've watched Democrats fall
for the same traps. Just so much anger and divisive behaviors.

Democrats threatening we vote for Kamala because it's the end of
democracy and Trump is going to personally punish me for my lifestyle
and we're all going in concentration camps and Tony Hinchcliffe is a
political fascist holding Nazi rallys. It never stops, politics
weren't like this a few years ago.

Numbers don't lie, it's my personal belief that accusing all
Republicans of being racist Nazis is why the Democrats
lost. Conservative people are tired of being labeled demons and now we
have no party that actually represents what most Americans want. I
don't like trump but I've come to realize he was no worse than any
other president and the media is to blame for the massive
misrepresentation of both parties. I don't think Trump will clean shit
up but I'm open minded because this is what we got for 4 years and
it's not an excuse to be an asshole to anyone.

People are just falling for the strategic goals of a foreign
enemy. Its been taught at the Russian military academies for 20 years
now:

>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the

>"Afro-American racists" to create severe backlash against the rotten

>separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively
>supporting all dissident movements â€“ extremist, racist, and sectarian
>groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the
>U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist

America leaves Euroasia, Russia-Iran-China divides it between
them. America's rich elite carves up the States and turns them in to
an oligarchy, just like the Russian model. Give it time, its
coming. People screamed for years about Soros, but think that Musk
will not play the very same game for his own ego and personal wealth? 

People do not realize, that part of how Putin stayed in power so long,
was that he stoked both the Far-Right and the Far-Left. He funded both
the old Communists, and the Neo-Nazi's - why? Because when the extreme
poles of society are busy screaming at each other, and you then make
it know you support it, nobody is really sure what and who are to
blame. The people in Washington called it
[Managed Perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_management)
(ed: link added)
back in the 90s. Instead people point at each other and scream in
impotence, while nothing is organized for changing things. Trump will
create his own swamp in time, because American politics now run on
vast amounts of money, and that is the thick soup that surrounds the
reeds.
