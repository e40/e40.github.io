That is worth repeating:

The entire tariff debacle perfectly illustrates this statement.
Authoritarian Trump didn't listen to *any* experts, all of whom would
have universally told him what would happen if he imposed that level
of tariffs on the entire world (except Russia!).  He couldn't prefict
a second-order effect and was therefore highly embarrassed (if he is
capabable of feeling that emotion) to have to rescind them a few days
later.
