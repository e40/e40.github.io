Fascism does have a logic. The issue is liberals are used to
empirical, correspondence versions of truth through discourse. So to
find a truth we test for the objective, "out there", truth, an
objective thing that truth measures. 

This is not truth to fascists. Truth is a verb. There is no "out
there" truth to fascists. It is a mythic view of the world,
reincorporated through the lens of instrumental logic. Long story
short, the world exists as a struggle for power of different
groups. The creation of group purity, destiny, providence, the
essential character of their group, is what the myth centers around. 

So truth is power. Whatever brings more power, more domination, more
humiliation for their opponents, is truth. The reason they attack
institutions is that institutions create a knowledge framework that
structures reality. They do not, fundamentally, believe in objective
truth, so institutions that create science are in service of some
group's power. The knowledge they produce is not the result of
nonfalsifiability, it is a performance to further the ends of... big
pharma, liberals, minorities, lgbtq people? Whomever, a degenerate
group that is not them. 

So they play the same trick against every institution. They use the
rules and taboos and good faith against them. So they accuse the
institition of breaking its most fundamental taboos, not being
empirical, not accepting heterodox views, being schills for interest
groups etc. The group then tries to engage in good faith, and fascists
use this as a toehold into the institution. Playing the victim of
persecution, they claim to just want "open discourse". They slowly
turn public opinion against the institution, and garner
concessions. But fascists pantomine the liberal game without ever
conceeding anything. And eventually, the perception created of a
corrupt institution leads to a complete usurpation by the
fascists. They then laugh as they purge any remaining scientists at
the weak naivety of assuming they were themselves bound by scruples of
fair play. The goal is attained, the husk of the institution now uses
its language, its conceptual frameworks, its appearance to produce
fascist knowledge. 

Truth is the ability to frame reality this way. It is why they don't
mind when Trump lies. They fucking love it. Why? Because he is
*producing truth*. He says "the gays have made technology to rain men
from the skies, it's raining men!" Then the media for a week runs
breathless coverage, liberals are outraged, the Republican party all
immediately starts saying it is obviously true but also he was
kidding. The New York Times launders it into normality by going to
excruciating lengths to make it coherent in a liberal
framework. "Trump Claims a Heightened Risk of Airline Collisions" is
their headline. The immense power demonstrated, the histrionics of
their enemy, the bending of reality around the statement, is to a
fascist a more pure truth than any experiment. 

They are nihilists. There are no principles beyond gaining power and
humiliating and hurting opponents. Certainly this is delusional from a
liberal, Enlightenment perspective, but it does carry its own
rationality. They have been trained by capitalism to function as
consumers, not citizens, and they choose their products based on what
feels empowering and gives them purpose. 

Fascism is the aesthetization of politics. Everything revolves around
spectacle, perfromance, simulation. It is clownish because it is all
based on television hyperbole, politics is a soap opera,
[Graham Hancock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hancock)
bases himself off what a regular person imagines an
archealogist does. They are, in a very real way in our postmodern
hellscape more true than true. They are the simulacrum of the things
they signify. Trump is how Americans imagine politics. Authority,
bravado, dick wagging, expertise is for nerds.
