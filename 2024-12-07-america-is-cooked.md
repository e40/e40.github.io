## Dragonfruit-Still's comment

**The USA has crossed a threshold of illiberalism that will usher in a new era of oligarchy and authoritarianism**

The US government is for sale. Fly to Mar a lago and join his
membership club, make large purchases of DJT, invest in Trumps crypto
shitcoin, or buy his untraceable NFTs. Or openly bribe voters to vote
for Trump. Or just buy a social media company and tune the algorithm
to favor one party.

We are miles beyond “manufacturing consent”. The corruption is in the
open, and we have a media that cannot communicate that corruption
effectively to a majority of its citizens. The facts are in the open
and the people simply don’t care.

And in fact people are crying over the hunter biden pardon even though
it represents a far lesser form of corruption (though still
condemnable) by orders of magnitude than what Trump has done for
example pardoning co conspirators.

The feedback loop is broken. I don’t see how we course correct here.

There won't be any course correction. America is cooked. The fact that
someone like him won the first time said that this nation's soul was
gravely ill, but given that he lost the popular vote and Hillary
Clinton was so unpopular, I made myself believe it was just a black
swan event. After everything we know about him out in the open, that
he could win a second time and win the popular vote at that means that
this is who we are as a country. Donald Trump is the "ugly American"
in concentrated form that the world despises. Ignorant, yet
arrogant. Knows little about the world and couldn't care less. Selfish
blowhards that can't stop talking about how great they
are. Unrefined. Anti-intellectual. Materialistic. Flashy. Indignant
and prone to acting like they are the victims when they are the
bully. Donald Trump is America personalified and America is Donald
Trump. I've just accepted it at this point.

Every few years I like to glance at The Economist's corruption
index. We usually compare to S. European countries. Still within the
norm of Western Europe, but well above places like Eastern Europe and
Latin America. I think we are now on a fast track toward the latter.

I was reading an interesting post about this topic on another sub and
someone was saying how corruption in places like Latin America isn't
just accepted, it's expected and seen as a way of life. If your
company needs something done, you have to curry favor with with the
people in power. Everything is transactional and nobody even tries to
hide it. You had to bribe someone to get things done. We're headed
there now. It was a nice run we had as a pluralistic liberal
Democracy. It's over. Fascism has won.

I've been saying for years that Trump is more like a Latin America
caudillo than a typical Western head of state. He seems like a
right-wing version of Hugo Chavez. With the same type of ride or die
cultists that will look past all his lies, corruption and incompetence
as long as they feel he's weilding power on their behalf and attacking
the people they hate.

Once you become this type of society and that trust is destroyed,
putting it back together will be damn near impossible. It takes
generations to build a trustworthy government, and only one despot to
smash it all to pieces.
