# The Plan

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Strength training is not optional.**  Longevity is positively
correlated with activity and strength training, as we age.

Grandpa and my son are already on the program, so it's my time to
start.  Honestly, I've felt myself slowing down over the last few
years and this is my way to combat that.

## How to choose a workout

I'm using _Arnold's Pump Club's 15-Minute Workouts_ you can get after
[signing up for his newsletter](http://www.schwarzenegger.com/join/).

What follows is essentially the _cheat sheet_ version of Arnold's
ebook, with some customization thrown in which is specially for me and
my physical limitations (_oh, to be young again and without physical
limitations!_):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. The Countdown

**GOALS: build muscle, burn fat, strengthen your heart**

**FREQUENCY: 3 or 4 days a week, w/1 rest day**

It's repeated alternating sets 5-15 reps (depending on experience) of
pushups and lunges, repeating until failure and stop when reps comes
down to is 1.  Time the workout, rest as little as possible between
excericses.  Can do 3-4 times a week, with a day of rest.

The pair of exercises can be changed up. Here are some pairs I like:

 1. pushups (5 reps) & sitting crunches
 2. **. . . find more!!**

[The Schedule](#TheSchedule).

### Alternate: 40 pushups

[Described here](https://e40.github.io/2023-05-17-the-longevity-test.html)
it should supersede the above until I can do 40 pushups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. The Cardio Fix

**GOALS: build muscle, burn fat, strengthen your heart**

**FREQUENCY: 3 or 4 days a week, w/1 rest day**

 1. Set timer for 10 minutes
 2. Walk for 1 minute.
 3. Run for 1 minute.
 4. goto (1) if time is < 10 minutes

For me, I will cycle and the "walk" and "run" will be done with RPMs
that have the same exertion as those two activities.

This can be done 3-4 times per week, resting a day in between.  Can
skip rest days, if desired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. The Hardest Minute

**GOALS: build strength, increase work capacity, experience crazy pumps**

**FREQUENCY: 2 days, 1 rest, 2 days, 1 rest, repeat**

 1. Pick exercise/focus muscle -- generally choose movements that
    require a lot of of muscles.
 2. Set timer for 1 minute
    * 8-12 reps (do weight can lift with good form for only 10 reps)
    * when finished rest remainder of minute
 3. Repeat (2) if iterations until time == 5 or 6

Can do this 2-4 times per week.  An example would be:

  * Mon: lower body (squats)
  * Tue: upper body (pushups)
  * Wed: rest
  * Thu: lower body (squats)
  * Fri: upper body (pushups)
  * Sat: rest
  * Sun: *...start from beginning...*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. The 5 Minute Workout Challenge

**GOAL: remove aches/pains, improve posture, mobility, and flexibility**

**FREQUENCY: every other day**

  * Movement #1: [world's greatest stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAEIdZSKQmI)
    * 6 reps, transition into...
  * Movement #2: [cat-cow stretch](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/multimedia/cat-cow-pose/vid-20453581)
    * 10 (complete) reps, then...
  * Movement #3: [90/90 hip switches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hl_ecZq6Uk)
    * 5 per side, then...
  * Movement #4: [10-second squat hold](https://youtu.be/1rIxbdd13S8?t=10)
    * 1 rep
  * Movement #5: bodyweight squats
    * 5-10 reps

The entire thing should take about 5 minutes.  It can be done every
day or every other day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. The Two-Dumbbell Workout

**GOAL: build muscle, burn fat, increase muscular endurance**

**Frequency: every other day**

 1. Set timer for 15 minutes.
 2. 10 reps of each one, in turn, of each of these exercises:
    * dumbbell row
    * dumbbell lunge
    * dumbbell overhead press
    * dumbbell Romanian deadlift
    * dumbbell overhead farmer's walk (walk with over head)
    * dumbbell squat
    * pushups
    Use amount of weight which allows 10 reps of overhead press.
 3. Do iterations of (2) until timer expires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Plan

### Pre-requisites

 * [PowerBlocks Pro 32 Adjustable Dumbbell Set](https://www.topfitness.com/collections/adjustable-dumbbells)

### Dependencies

Workouts (1), (3) and (5) should not be done on the same day and have
a day of rest in between any of them.

Workouts (2) and (4) can be done independently of each other and the
previous workouts.

### Repetition

There are these types of workouts:

  * 1 day, 1 rest, repeat (e.g., every other day)
    * **exercises**: (4), (5)
    * **repeats after 3 weeks**
    * ChatGPT: I want to do an activity every other day, how many
       whole weeks before it repeats?
  * 2 days, 1 rest, 2 days, 1 rest, repeat
    * **exercises**: (3)
    * **repeats after 2 weeks**
    * **ChatGPT**: I want to do an activity 2 days in a row, with 1
      day of rest and then repeat,  how many whole weeks before it
      repeats?
  * 3 days a week, w/1 rest day
    * **exercises**: (1), (2)
    * **repeats after 4 weeks**
    * **ChatGPT**: If I want to do an activity 3 days every week with
      exactly 1 day of rest in between, how many whole weeks before it
      starts to repeat?
  * 4 days a week, w/1 rest day
    * **exercises**: (1), (2)
    * **repeats after 5 weeks**
    * **ChatGPT**: If I want to do an activity 4 days every week with
      exactly 1 day of rest in between, how many whole weeks before it
      starts to repeat?

## The Schedule

Until pre-requisites are met, can't do (5).

Rather than use the repetition info above and do a 12 week repeating
schedule (LCM of 3 and 4... yikes!!) will do the following:

| **Day of Week** | **Strength (10m)** | **Cardio (10m)** | **Stretch (5m)** |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Sun**         | (1)                | (2)              | (4)              |
| **Mon**         | (3) lower          |                  |                  |
| **Tue**         | (3) upper          | (2)              | (4)              |
| **Wed**         | (1)                |                  |                  |
| **Thu**         | (3) lower          | (2)              | (4)              |
| **Fri**         | (3) upper          |                  |                  |
| **Sat**         |                    | (2)              | (4)              |

Links to exercises:
  * [(1)](#ex1) - pushups & crunches **OR** 40 pushups & crunches
  * [(2)](#ex2) - bike
  * [(3)](#ex3) - upper: pushups / lower: squats
