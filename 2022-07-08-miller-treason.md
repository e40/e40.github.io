And it is VERY important everyone connect the dots to that instruction by the “Secretary” of Defense to who made the call. 

I cannot say this loudly enough:

Without ultra MAGA hack Christopher Miller running the Defense department, NONE of the violence on Jan 6 happens. NONE.

Miller should spend the rest of his life in jail. 

Please read on if you doubt those statements. 

Because I don’t feel Miller gets enough heat for his role in Jan 6:

1) Miller didn’t give order as the “Secretary” of Defense. He was the “acting” Secretary of Defense. 

2) and he was the acting Secretary that day, because the Secretary of Defense is a Senate-approved position. And Trump’s M.O. during his presidency was to rifle through cabinet appointments until he found loyal idiots who would commit fraud on his behalf. 

3) So….on November 9, 2021, (edit: 2020) after Trump was aware he lost the popular vote and EC in a landslide, he fired Mark Esper and appointed Christopher Miller as his new “acting” Secretary of Defense.

4) Trump absolutely needed a Sec of Def who was on board with the coup/sedition plans. And Miller was his guy. Miller was brought in on November 9 to specifically help Trump steal the election over the next 60 days:

* when Trump appointee Miller on Nov 9, the top REPUBLICAN on House Armed Services Committee (Rep. Mac Thornberry) expressed concern that the sudden shake-up and installation of leadership at the Pentagon based on political fealty instead of expertise "endanger U.S. national security."

* Miller's chief of staff as Acting Secretary of Defense was Kash Patel, a former aide to Congressman Devin Nunes. (Patel is known for efforts to discredit investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.)

* In December 2020, it was reported that Miller had ordered the Pentagon to postpone 40 meetings with the incoming Joe Biden administration. Miller's decision to halt cooperation with the incoming administration came in the wake of President Donald Trump's refusal to concede in the election, refusals by various Trump administration political appointees to cooperate, and claims of fraud by the Trump administration.

* On January 3, 2021, all TEN living former defense secretaries raised alarm in an open letter regarding a potential military coup to overturn the election results, warning officials who may participate, and specifically naming Miller, that they would face grave consequences if they violated the constitution.

Edit [WAPO source of the Op-Ed these ten former defense secretaries wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/10-former-defense-secretaries-military-peaceful-transfer-of-power/2021/01/03/2a23d52e-4c4d-11eb-a9f4-0e668b9772ba_story.html)
 
* According to Miller's later statements, on January 3 he was ordered by Trump to "do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators" on January 6. (The following day, Miller issued orders which prohibited deploying D.C. Guard members with weapons, helmets, body armor or riot control agents without his personal approval. On January 5, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy issued a memo placing limits on the District of Columbia National Guard. Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, later explained: "All military commanders normally have immediate response authority to protect property, life, and in my case, federal functions — federal property and life. But in this instance I did not have that authority.")

* Miller's actions on January 6 also faced scrutiny. After rioters breached the Capitol Police perimeter, Miller waited more than three hours before authorizing the deployment of the National Guard. Miller didn't provide that permission until 4:32 pm, after assets from Virginia had already entered the District, and Trump had instructed rioters to "go home".
