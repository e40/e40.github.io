I really love HN. It's the only _social media_ site I participate in.
It is heavily moderated and users build trust among each other over
time.  It's an amazing place.

Below are some of my favorite comments in recent months.
Ordered by most recent first.

The context of the reply below is this:

Such a wild story.
