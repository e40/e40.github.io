Yes, *that* Governor Schwarzenegger.  I recommend a tour through
his post history.
The only changes were to automatically scan to text (it was a

Want to know how long you will live? You can spend hundreds of dollars
on hypothetical tests that measure your "biological age" - which is
not a scientific measure - or you can drop and give me 40.

That's because **research suggests the number of pushups you can perform
helps determine how long you will live.**

There's nothing special about pushups, per se, but tests that combine
strength, movement, and cardiovascular health tend to be some of the
best indicators of longevity.

Many companies are starting to push "biological aging" tests. You can
try them, but buyer beware: improving your biological age does not
necessarily mean you'll live longer. It's not a proven method.

There's better evidence that physical capabilities, such as grip
strength, are a better indicator of longevity. In this study conducted
by Harvard scientists, people who did 40 pushups were associated with
a 96 percent reduction of a potentially deadly cardiovascular event,
compared with those who could complete fewer than ten push-ups.

If you need help increasing your pushup strength, we have you covered
in today's workout of the week.

# Workout of the Week

Who's ready to do more pushups and live a little longer? We promised
to help increase the number of pushups you can perform, so this week's
workout is a 4-week program designed to make you stronger and increase
your upper body muscular endurance. It's this combination that is the
secret to the fountain of youth.

If you need help with performing the perfect pushup,

If pushups are too difficult, you can do them from your
knees. Or, place your hands on a bench - instead of the floor - for an
[incline pushup](https://www.verywellfit.com/incline-push-up-for-beginners-3120038)
(ed: unknown what the original link was), which is an easier variation.

**Here's the test:**

First, set a timer for 1 minute, and then perform as many pushups as
you can. That's it. Record the number of reps you performed, and
that's your starting position. Remember, it's more important to
perform good pushups than do fake ones. Don't lie to yourself because
it only harms you. Think about it. You can stuff socks in vour sleeves
to pretend you have bigger biceps, or you can actually build them the
right way. Let's check your ego, and all improve together!

So how did you do? Remember, the goal is 40 straight pushups. We don't
care if you got 40 or just 4. The fun part is the journey and watching
yourself get better.

Now, it's time to improve.

If your pushup score is lower than you'd like, here's a program that
will help you improve. You can do this as a standalone workout, make
it the first exercise in an upper body or push day workout, or make it
the first exercise in a full-body training program.

## Week 1 (Perform twice per week)

__If you did 10 or fewer pushups:__

* Perform 10 sets of 3 repetitions of pushups. Rest two minutes
  between sets.
* If you can't do 3 pushups, adjust to an easier variation.
* If the easiest variation is difficult, don't worry about it! Perform
  as many as you can, rest, and keep going until you complete a set of
  3 reps. Instead of doing 10 sets, perform 4 to 5 total sets.

__If you did 10 or more pushups:__

* Perform 10 sets of 8 repetitions of pushups. Rest two minutes
  between sets.

## Week 2 (Perform twice per week)

__If you did 10 or fewer pushups:__

* Perform 8 sets of 5 repetitions of pushups. Rest two minutes between sets.
* If you can't do 5 pushups, adjust to an easier variation.
* If the easiest variation is difficult, don't worry about it! Perform
  as many as you can, rest, and keep going until you complete a set of
  5 reps. Instead of doing 8 sets, perform 4 to 5 total sets.

__If you did 10 or more pushups:__

* Complete 8 sets of 10 repetitions with 2 minutes of rest between
  sets.

## Week 3 (Perform twice per week)

__If you did 10 or fewer pushups:__

* Perform 6 sets of 7 repetitions of pushups. Rest one minute between sets.
* If you can't do 7 pushups, adjust to an easier variation, and follow
  the same instructions as the prior two weeks.  

__If you did 10 or more pushups:__

* Perform 6 sets of 15 repetitions with 1 minute of rest between sets.

## Week 4 (Perform twice per week)

__If vou did 10 or fewer pushups:__

* Perform 5 sets of 9 repetitions of pushups. Rest two minutes between sets.
* If you can't do 9 pushups, adjust to an easier variation, and follow
  the same instructions as the prior two weeks.

__If vou did 10 or more pushups:__

* Do 4 sets of 20 repetitions with two minutes of rest between sets.

Once the four weeks are up, take off 3 to 5 days from pushups, and
then it's time to test again! We promise if you stick to the program,
your number will improve a lot in just 4 weeks. We'll be following up
to see how you did.
