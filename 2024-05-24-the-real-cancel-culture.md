# The real cancel culture

Been hearing a lot of Bari Weiss and Common Sense, now The Free Press.
I couldn't tell if they were lefties or righties, why they were so mad
at the left, etc.

Judd Legum [wrote an article](https://popular.info/p/the-real-cancel-culture)
about the issues.

It's interesting to me how these self proclaimed lefties seem to share
so many traits with the right, sometimes the far right.  The lying,
the making it all about them and the personal attacks.  What the far
right has accelerated since the Trump era is the creation of a reality
distortion field and these people seem to be down with that.  I
suspect, because it makes them so much money.

Also, Jon Stewart did a beautiful [takedown of cancel
culture](https://youtu.be/WwyyttqvE04?si=dyYPlA4DiOseQPqn) on The
Daily Show.
