# The Powell Memorandum (1971) gave us Trump

The [Powell
Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_F._Powell_Jr.#Powell_Memorandum,_1971)
led directly to what we see today and the reign of the criminal,
billionaire class.

Powell served on the Supreme Court of the US from 1972 to 1987.

Here's the short summary:
 * he argued America was under attack from intellectuals, the media,
   campuses, and other cultural institutions
 * businesses need to respond with a sustained, organized and
   aggressive counteroffensive
 * what was required to fight this was long-term strategic action
   (which culminated in [Project 2025][10])
 * recommended tactics: influence education, media, the courts,
   and create think tanks to influence politics

All of that should be familiar.  1971 was 54 years ago.  The plan that
culminated in Donald J Trump's 2nd term was started 54 years ago.

Here's a longer summary, but I do recommend reading the Wikipedia
article linked above:

The **Powell Memorandum** (titled *“Attack on American Free Enterprise
System”*), dated August 23, 1971, was a confidential memo written by
Lewis F. Powell Jr. to Eugene B. Sydnor Jr. of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. Powell argued that the American free enterprise system was
under a “broad attack” from intellectuals, the media, academia
(especially campuses), and other cultural institutions, and he urged
business to respond with a sustained, organized, and aggressive
counteroffensive. The memo framed the situation not as isolated
grievances but as an existential ideological struggle requiring
long-term strategic action. ([Biotech Law][1])

Key recommendations in the memo included building and funding a wide
array of institutional and cultural levers to defend and promote
pro-business ideas. Among the major tactics Powell laid out were:

* **Influencing education and scholarship**: fund scholars, create
  “scholars-on-call,” establish business-friendly research and
  academic networks, and shape curricula to produce favorable opinion
  over time. ([Al Jazeera Interactives][2])
* **Shaping public opinion and media**: monitor and critique the
  media, develop communications strategies, and support favorable
  editorial content to counter narratives hostile to free
  enterprise. ([Al Jazeera Interactives][2])
* **Legal and judicial influence**: build and support legal
  organizations, cultivate lawyers sympathetic to business, and use
  the courts to defend corporate interests. ([Alliance for
  Justice][3])
* **Political and lobbying organization**: coordinate business
  lobbying, voter education, and political activism to ensure policy
  and regulatory environments favored enterprise. ([Senator Sheldon
  Whitehouse][4])
* **Institutional infrastructure**: create think tanks, legal advocacy
  groups, and funding mechanisms to sustain influence over decades
  rather than ad hoc responses. ([Greenpeace][5], [Virginia
  Business][6])

The memo is widely cited as a seminal moment in the modern corporate
political mobilization era. Supporters of its historical significance
argue it provided a blueprint that helped seed and accelerate the
development of conservative think tanks, legal strategies, and
institutional networks that have shaped American public policy and
discourse. Critics see it as an intentional blueprint for “corporate
takeover” of democracy and cultural institutions, alleging it
kickstarted a coordinated effort to entrench business power; others
caution that while influential, its role has been debated—some portray
it as an overblown conspiracy narrative, others as a clear
catalyst. ([Virginia Business][6], [Inside Higher Ed][7], [Alliance
for Justice][3])

In sum, the Powell Memorandum called for business to stop reacting
defensively and instead to build lasting, proactive structures across
education, media, law, and politics to defend and advance free
enterprise—an agenda whose echoes and consequences are still discussed
and contested in analyses of American political economy. ([Lira][8],
