I work in software research for satellite systems and oh man, let me tell you what people learned from that one image he released. 

Within hours of his tweet of the photo, amateur satellite trackers worked to identify when the photo was taken and which satellites could have taken it. Satellite orbit data is publicly available - even for classified satellites (it’s hard to hide a satellite orbiting earth). When classified satellites are built and launched, the public knows they exist but no one knows their purpose or capabilities (instruments, resolution, hardware, etc.). Amateurs estimated the time of the image to be between 1:30-2:30 in the afternoon and that narrowed it down to one specific satellite: USA-224, owned by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). This means that all foreign nations now know this particular satellite is used for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and that it has an electro-optical camera onboard.

Likewise, satellite image researchers set out to ascertain the resolution of the image. Satellite image resolution is stated as the ground distance covered by one pixel. There are multiple commercial players in the satellite image space, but Planet and Maxar are two of the biggest ones. Maxar has the highest resolution products that natively produce 30cm resolution (each pixel represents 30cm on the ground). Native resolution refers to the resolution of the camera on the satellite. Further, they apply machine learning super resolution to the images and achieve _15cm resolution_, which is impressive! 

Researchers estimate that the resolution of the image released by Trump is _at least 10cm._ That means USA-224 achieves _at least 3x greater native resolution_ than the leading commercial product! You have to remember that this satellite was launched back in 2011 too.

Obviously, this isn’t information you want your adversaries to know. Now, they know this satellite has electro-optical capabilities, at what resolution it takes images, and its orbit which can be propagated over time.
